# Django-firstProject

Welcome to **Django-firstProject**, a personal repository documenting my learning journey with Django. This project serves as a collection of notes and examples to help me understand the basics of Django development. Although this isn't a fully functional application, it encompasses the fundamental concepts of Django I have explored so far.

## Overview

This repository covers my learning milestones in Django, including starting a server, defining models, working with templates, configuring URLs, and exploring relationships and forms. Below is a breakdown of the topics I learned:

---

### **Topics Covered**

#### 1. Start a Django Server
- Set up a virtual environment and installed Django.
- Ran the default development server using `python manage.py runserver`.

#### 2. Creating Our First Views
- Learned about the concept of views and created basic functions in `views.py` to display responses.

#### 3. Adding Templates
- Used Django's template engine to create `HTML` files for rendering dynamic content.

#### 4. Adding CSS and JavaScript
- Integrated static files like CSS and JavaScript into the project by configuring `STATICFILES_DIRS` and linking them in templates.

#### 5. Jinja Templates App in Django
- Explored Jinja2 syntax to include dynamic data in templates and loop through objects in views.

#### 6. Tailwind to Django
- Integrated **Tailwind CSS** with Django to style templates using utility-first CSS classes.

#### 7. Enable the Admin Panel in Django
- Activated Django's powerful admin interface by enabling and customizing the `admin.py` file for model management.

#### 8. Defining a Model
- Learned to define models in `models.py` for database representation and structure.

#### 9. Adding Data to the Database
- Used Django's ORM and admin interface to add sample data to the database.

#### 10. Creating a View to Display the Data
- Displayed database content dynamically in templates using queries and context variables.

#### 11. Get Data in the Template
- Utilized template tags to fetch and display data, such as looping over objects or accessing attributes.

#### 12. Adding Description to the Model and Details Page
- Enhanced models by adding descriptions and created detail pages for individual objects.

#### 13. Adding a Details View
- Added dedicated views to handle the display of detailed information about specific objects.

#### 14. Configuring the urls.py File
- Learned to configure `urls.py` to define paths for routing between views and templates.

#### 15. Relationships and Forms in Django
- Explored database relationships, including **foreign keys** and **many-to-many** relationships, and implemented forms for user input.
